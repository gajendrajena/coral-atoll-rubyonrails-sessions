2. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd
3. WAP to print even numbers between 1 to 100
4. WAP to print odd numbers between 1 to 100
5. WAP to check if a number is prime
if a number is divisible by 1 and itself e.g. 2, divisible by only 1 and 2

6. WAP to check if a number is perfect
if the sum of all the divisors except itself of a number is equal to the number
  e.g. 6, divisors 1, 2, 3  sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

1.WAF to reverse a string
e.g. "Hello" -> "olleH"
str  = "Hello"
res  = reverse_str(str)
res # => "olleH"

2. WAF to find a char in a string

str  = "Hello"
char_to_search = 'l'
res  = search_str(str, char_to_search)
res # => true

3. WAF to find index of a char in a string

str  = "Hello"
char_to_search = 'l'
res  = index_str(str, char_to_search)
res # => 2

3. WAF to find all the indices of a char in a string

str  = "Hello"
char_to_search = 'l'
res  = indices_str(str, char_to_search)
res # => [2, 3]
